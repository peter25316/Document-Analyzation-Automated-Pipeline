# Progress Report: An Automated Pipeline for Analyzing Governmental and Public Sentiment in Renewable Energy Development

## Date: Week 1 - September 15, 2025

### Topics of discussion
The original idea was to develop a scoring system for candidate solar project sites based on interconnection feasibility and public sentiment analysis.

The project scope was identified as very wide.

A significant challenge was encountered in trying to locate and acquire the necessary data for both parts of the analysis.

### Action Items:
- [x] Documented the initial, broad project goal.
- [x] Conducted preliminary research for both interconnection and public sentiment data sources.
- [x] Identified data acquisition as a major roadblock requiring a scope reassessment.

## Date: Week 2 - September 22, 2025

### Topics of discussion
In conversation with the company, the project scope was officially narrowed to focus solely on the public sentiment analysis.

A detailed list of "Data Points of Interest" was defined to guide the research.

The initial technical assumption was that these data points could be extracted directly from documents using standard NLP/ML analysis.

### Action Items:
- [x] Formally redefined the project's scope and objectives.
- [x] Documented the specific "Data Points of Interest" as the new core requirements.
- [x] Began the targeted collection of public PDF documents from Halifax County.
- [x] Manually review a sample of documents to confirm their content and format.

## Date: Week 3 - September 29, 2025

### Topics of discussion
Realized that the data is far messier than anticipated and that a well-structured dataset must be created before any analysis is possible.

Shifted the project focus to designing and building a robust data engineering pipeline (OCR -> Staging Database -> LLM Transformation).

The most recent progress is the successful completion of the OCR and staging phase.

### Action Items:
- [x] Defined the data pipeline architecture.
- [x] Wrote and successfully ran the OCR script to populate the ocr_data.db file with raw text.
- [x] Wrote and successfully tested the script to fetch records from the database, confirming it is ready for the next step.
- [ ] Write the final script to send the fetched text to the Gemini API for structured data extraction.
